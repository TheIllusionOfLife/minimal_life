"""Proxy control comparison experiment.

Runs 3 metabolism conditions on the same seeds to demonstrate that
graph metabolism provides qualitative advantage over simpler proxies.

Conditions:
  1. graph   - Full graph-based multi-step metabolism
  2. toy     - Intermediate single-step with waste dynamics
  3. counter - Minimal single-step, no waste production

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/experiment_proxy.py > experiments/proxy_data.tsv

Output: TSV data to stdout + summary report to stderr.
